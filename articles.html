            <h3>The Importance of Regular Dental Check-Ups</h3>
            <img src="Images\AdobeStock_473854744.jpeg" alt="Dental Check-Up" width="500" class="article-img">
            <p>Our smiles bring joy, confidence, and wellbeing—but maintaining them requires proactive care. Annual dental check-ups are the foundation of lifelong oral health, and here’s why they matter:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Early Detection:</strong> Dentists can spot cavities, gum disease, or even oral cancer in early stages—when treatment is simpler, less painful, and more affordable.</li>
                <li><strong>Preventive Care:</strong> Professional cleanings remove plaque and tartar that brushing alone can’t eliminate, reducing the risk of tooth decay and gum inflammation.</li>
                <li><strong>Personalized Guidance:</strong> Your dentist will tailor advice to your needs—like adjusting your brushing technique or recommending products for sensitive teeth.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Don’t wait for a toothache—schedule your check-up today by calling 07 5000 5599!</p>

            <h3>Tips for Maintaining Oral Hygiene at Home</h3>
            <img src="Images\AdobeStock_261497775.jpeg" alt="Oral Hygiene Routine" width="500" class="article-img">
            <p>Daily habits shape your dental health. Follow these simple tips to keep your smile bright and healthy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Brush twice a day (morning and night) with fluoride toothpaste—spend 2 minutes each time, and use a soft-bristled brush to avoid damaging gums.</li>
                <li>Floss daily to clean between teeth—food bits stuck here can cause cavities if left unchecked.</li>
                <li>Limit sugary snacks and drinks (like soda, candy, or pastries)—sugar feeds bacteria that erode tooth enamel.</li>
                <li>Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months (or after illness)—old brushes hold germs and lose effectiveness.</li>
                <li>Drink water with fluoride—it strengthens enamel and helps wash away food particles between meals.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Understanding Dental Implants</h3>
            <img src="Images\AdobeStock_372290824.jpeg" alt="Dental Implants" width="500" class="article-img">
            <p>Dental implants are a durable, natural-looking solution for missing teeth. They consist of a small metal post (surgically placed in your jaw) and a custom crown (fake tooth) that attaches to the post. Unlike dentures, implants stay in place and help preserve jawbone strength (missing teeth can cause bone loss over time).</p>
            <p>Most people with healthy gums and jawbones are good candidates for implants. Talk to Dr. Sloan to learn if implants are right for you.</p>

            <h3>How to Choose the Right Toothbrush</h3>
            <img src="Images\AdobeStock_283903376.jpeg" alt="Choosing a Toothbrush" width="500" class="article-img">
            <p>Not all toothbrushes work the same—here’s what to look for to keep your teeth clean without damage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Soft bristles:</strong> Hard bristles can scratch enamel and irritate gums—opt for "soft" or "extra soft" labels.</li>
                <li><strong>Small head:</strong> A compact head makes it easier to reach back teeth (which are often missed during brushing).</li>
                <li><strong>Ergonomic handle:</strong> A handle that fits comfortably in your hand helps you brush with consistent pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>Electric vs. manual:</strong> Electric brushes are great for people who struggle with proper technique, but manual brushes work too—just focus on gentle, circular motions.</li>
            </ul>
