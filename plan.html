  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> ZHUO QIXUAN </p>
  
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>Develop a professional website for 100SMILES Dental Care to showcase its dental services, team expertise, promotional offers, and oral health education. The site aims to increase new patient inquiries by 20% within 6 months, simplify access to clinic information for Razole residents, and enhance community awareness of preventive dental care.</p>
  
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>1. Track new patient bookings that reference the website (via phone or email) and achieve a 20% increase compared to pre-launch data over 6 months.<br>
  2. Achieve a redemption rate of at least 10% for the "20% off first visit" promotion advertised on the site.<br>
  3. Receive positive feedback from 70%+ of users surveyed, indicating the website helped them make informed decisions about dental care.<br>
  4. Ensure the website functions smoothly across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) with no broken links or layout issues.</p>
  
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>Primary audience includes: Families in Razole (25-45 years old) who make healthcare decisions for children (5-12) and elderly relatives; individuals seeking preventive care (check-ups, cleanings); patients needing orthodontic treatments (braces, Invisalign); and emergency cases requiring same-day appointments. They value clear information, professional credentials, and convenient access to services via mobile and desktop devices.</p>
